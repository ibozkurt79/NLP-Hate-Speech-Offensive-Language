# NLP-Hate-Speech-Offensive-Language
Used NLP, NLTK, POS, tf-idf, implemented CNN , LinearSVC, LR, RF
I was motivated with this project after seeing a lot of discussions and criticism to Twitter, and Facebook for their under performance to implement robust and swift rules in dealing with rising hate speech on social media. 
Thanks to a similar academic work on the subject, I implemented different algorithms to improve a classifier which produced a %80 accuracy. However, this accuracy can be improve with more samples, and better choice in classifying sample data.
I believe this model can be improved by identifying a threshold supported with user inouts, thus creating a better accuracy for implementers
